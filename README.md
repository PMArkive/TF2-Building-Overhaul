# TF2-Building-Overhaul
Allows players to build buildings, a lot of them


## What Makes This Special ##

Yes, there are already a few "unlimited buildings" plugins already on AlliedModders, but this one goes absolutely bonkers and off the wall with memory manipulation.

With this plugin, you are able to:
- Actually "build" an unlimited(ish) number of buildings
- Destroy your buildings with your PDA in order of creation.
- Wrangle each and every one of your sentries.
- Link up multiple teleporter sets.
- Pick up and carry all of your extra buildings.

### Requirements ###
